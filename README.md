# Jumbo-Shell-and-File-System

Jumbo Shell and File System project is a comprehensive implementation of an interactive shell and a direct indexed file system, developed using C programming language and Linux environment.

The Jumbo Shell offers a rich set of features that enable users to execute most commonly used Linux commands interactively, with support for multitasking processes, output redirection, and piping. The shell provides a user-friendly interface that allows for efficient and effective interaction with the underlying operating system.

The Jumbo File System, on the other hand, is a direct indexed file system implemented on a simulated disk. It offers a variety of file operations, including directory creation and deletion, file reading and writing, and viewing properties. The file system is designed to be efficient and reliable, providing a robust platform for data storage and retrieval.
